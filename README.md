The game consists of the player trying to move the piglet to collect as many coins as he can in one minute while trying to dodge food that would take away coins.

The player starts the game without coins. Coins will fall from the top of the screen just like food.

The piglet will be located at the bottom of the screen and the player can move it from left to right by sliding his finger to the desired location.

The player will lose the game if within the minute of play he is left with a balance of less than 0 in coins, this can only happen because he has collided with food.

The player will win the game if he spends the minute of play with a balance equal to or greater than 0 in coins. The more coins he has collected, the more merit the player has for his victory.
